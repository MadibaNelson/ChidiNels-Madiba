Because of that where words fail, music speaks. where word leave off, music begins. Music, once admitted to the soul, becomes a sort of spirit, and never dies, why because it touches us emotionally where words alone can't. <br><br>Music, when soft voices die, vibrates in the memory. It is an agreeable harmony for the honor of God and the permissible delights of the soul. They are not more than five music notes, yet the combination of these five give rise to more melodies than can ever be heard. Music is healing and thus holds thing together. <br><br>
